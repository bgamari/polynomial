-- |Returns the Lagrange basis set of polynomials associated with a set of
-- points. This is the set of polynomials each of which is @1@ at its
-- corresponding point in the input list and @0@ at all others.
--
-- These polynomials are especially convenient, mathematically, for
-- interpolation.  The interpolating polynomial for a set of points  @(x,y)@
-- is given by using the @y@s as coefficients for the basis given by
-- @lagrangeBasis xs@.  Computationally, this is not an especially stable
-- procedure though.  'Math.Polynomial.Interpolation.lagrangePolyFit'
-- implements a slightly better algorithm based on the same idea.
--
-- Generally it is better to not compute the coefficients at all.
-- 'Math.Polynomial.Interpolation.polyInterp' evaluates the interpolating
-- polynomial directly, and is both quicker and more stable than any method
-- I know of that computes the coefficients.
